- **Interactive Chart**: Click timeframe buttons (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y) to change the view

## Understanding the Data

### Key Metrics Explained (for Beginners)

- **Market Cap**: Total value of all company shares. Bigger = larger company
- **P/E Ratio**: Price-to-Earnings ratio. Lower often means better value, but context matters
- **Dividend Yield**: Percentage of price paid as dividends annually
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded today
- **52 Week High/Low**: Highest and lowest prices in the past year
- **EPS**: Earnings per share. How much profit each share represents
- **Beta**: Volatility measure. >1 = more volatile than market, <1 = less volatile

## API Usage Tips

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 25 API calls per day
- 5 API calls per minute

**What counts as a call:**
- Selecting a stock = 2 calls (quote + overview)
- Changing timeframe = 1 call (chart data)

**Pro tip**: The app caches data for 1 minute, so switching between stocks you've already viewed won't use extra API calls!

**Fallback**: If you hit rate limits, the app will show mock data so you can still use it.

## Troubleshooting

### "Loading..." stuck on screen
- Check that your API key is correct in `.env.local`
- Make sure you've restarted the dev server after adding the API key
- Check browser console for error messages

### Rate limit exceeded
- Wait a few minutes before making more requests
- The app will automatically fall back to mock data

### Charts not showing
- This is normal when using the demo API key
- Get your own free API key to see real data

## Next Steps

Now that you're up and running, try:

1. Exploring different stocks (click the stock buttons)
2. Viewing different timeframes on the charts
3. Reading the company descriptions
4. Comparing metrics across different companies
